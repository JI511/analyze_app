# analyze_app

This is a Python Django web application created to analyze my NBA data set.

The repository for my data set generator can be found here: https://github.com/JI511/NBA_Beautiful_Data. This repository
 also handles the plotting functionality so this repository only calls the API.

Current look as of 11/30/2019:
